# Release Notes

Hi everyone,

Today (April 12th), D&D Beyond updated their character sheet, which broke the parsing of the Initiative modifier. Due to that breaking change, we're releasing yet another small bugfix update to your favorite extension.

We also fixed a couple of issues that might have affected the DDB mobile app parsing of the game log when rolling from Beyond20, and added support for Foundry VTT's upcoming v10 release.

As usual, thank you to all my [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters, who are making this possible. 

Happy rolling!
