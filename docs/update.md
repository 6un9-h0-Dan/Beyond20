# Release Notes

Hi again, we're releasing another small bugfix release today for your favorite extension.

This update had to be quickly released as there were two breaking changes that happened this week, one change in the D&D Beyond character sheet which caused some issues with the character specific settings not working properly, and also a change in the Roll20 website which caused HP syncing to stop working in most situations. 

This release also adds a couple of other small but important bug fixes and features as well. See the short [Changelog](#changelog) below for more details.

As usual, thank you to all my [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters, who are making this possible. 

Happy rolling!
